# Quick Start Guide

This step-by-step guide walks you through the **core-concepts** of Embeddable.

## Prerequisites

Before starting on this guide, make sure you have the following software installed:

- A code-editor suitable for JavaScript such as [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- The latest LTS version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- The version-control system [Git](https://git-scm.com/install/)

This guide also assumes a basic understanding of the programming language JavaScript.

## Setting Up The Boilerplate

The [boilerplate repository](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/remarkable-pro-boilerplate) is a starting point for this guide. It includes the full suite of (Remarkable Pro components)[https://github.com/embeddable-hq/remarkable-pro], our production-ready component library.

<Steps>

### Getting the Code

Download our boilerplate repository [here](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/remarkable-pro-boilerplate) (`<> Code` -> `Download ZIP`), or clone it using the git command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/embeddable-hq/remarkable-pro-boilerplate
```

Open the folder in a code-editor.

### Installing Dependencies

In a terminal (using VsCode: Menu Bar -> Terminal -> New Terminal), run:

```sh
npm i
```

to install all required dependencies.

### Set Your Region

In the `embeddable.config.ts` file, set either:

```ts
region: "EU",
```

**or**

```ts
region: "US",
```

depending on [your region](https://docs.embeddable.com/deployment/deployment-regions). Make sure to save these changes before continuing.

</Steps>

## Connecting to Your Embeddable Workspace

Follow these three steps to complete basic set-up.

<Steps>

### Logging in

To connect to embeddable, run the terminal command:

```sh
npm run embeddable:login
```

### Building

Next, bundle the boilerplate repository, so that we can use it in an embeddable dashboard, by running:

```sh
npm run embeddable:build
```

### Pushing

Finally, we have to send our code-bundle to Embeddable. To do so run:

```sh
npm run embeddable:push
```

To learn more about the push command and it's options, see [Push command](/development/pushing-code#push-command)

</Steps>

todo: go to dashboard and see components. decide on how much to write here when next section is complete.
